#summary Important notes about the Splitta package

* There is a small issue with SVM_LIGHT. The packaged model was created with verion 6.02. If your version of SVM_CLASSIFY is other than 6.02, you should try changing the first line of model_svm/svm_model (automatically created by SVM_LEARN) to match your version. If that doesn't work, please let me know.

* Apparently, there are problems if you try to run the package with Python 3.0. Sometime in the future this will be fixed. 2.5 <= working version < 3.0.
